# A brief explanation about sorting.

The insertionSort function takes an array as input and sorts it in ascending order. The outer for loop iterates over the array, starting from the second element. The inner while loop compares the current element (array[i]) with the elements before it. If the current element is less than an element at index j, the element at index j is shifted one position to the right. This process continues until the current element is at its correct position in the sorted array.
